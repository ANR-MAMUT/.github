# ANR MAMUT - Urban Mobility Optimization

## Project Overview

Urban mobility, defined as the transport of goods and people, has profoundly transformed our economy and lifestyles. Today, it must also meet sustainability requirements. The **MAMUT** project aims to tackle the challenges of urban logistics by leveraging cutting-edge research in **Operations Research (OR)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Our goal is to provide innovative solutions for more sustainable and efficient transport of goods in urban environments.

### Context

- According to the **Shift Project report (March 2022)**:
  - On average, **27 tons of goods** are transported annually over **200 km per French person**.
  - Urban freight accounts for **9% of greenhouse gas emissions**, with **89% from road transport** and **9% from rail**.
  
- The **French Economy Transformation Plan (PTEF)** proposes:
  - Organizing **urban pooling centers** to optimize freight loadings.
  - Increasing reliance on **electric vehicles** and **cyclologistics** for deliveries.
  - Training drivers in **eco-driving practices**.

### Challenges in Urban Logistics

Urban logistics involves dynamic and complex challenges, such as:

- Managing deliveries with **heterogeneous vehicle fleets**.
- Navigating **restricted traffic zones** in city centers.
- Addressing the **inefficiency of the last mile** of freight logistics.
- Responding to increased delivery demands due to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The **MAMUT** project seeks to address these challenges by combining the strengths of OR and AI, creating adaptive and efficient solutions for urban freight transport.

## Objectives

The MAMUT project is structured around three main objectives:

### Objective 1: Characterization of Urban Logistics Instances
- Identify and analyze various instances of urban logistics problems.
- Characterize these problems using specific indicators and explain their behavior through **machine learning**.

### Objective 2: Hybrid OR/AI Solver
- Develop a scalable and generic solver combining:
  - **Metaheuristics** from operations research for problem-specific optimization.
  - **Machine learning** techniques to leverage historical data.

### Objective 3: Open-Source Platform
- Build an open-source platform featuring:
  - Resolved logistics problems.
  - Large, realistic datasets for research and industry use.
  - Algorithms, including the **hybrid OR/AI solver**.

The platform will be accessible to the scientific and industrial community, fostering collaboration and innovation in urban logistics.
